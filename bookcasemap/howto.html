<h1>HowTo</h1>
Normal maps are based on OverPass Turbo data. The issue is not to overload that end point. So some caching is required. As a challenge I'm building it without a server, mainly using github.com for the hosting and Google Drive & Google Sheets for the data part.<br/>

<ul>
<li>Leaflet map, data in JSON files (structured?)</li>
<li>JSON files stored on a google drive</li>
<li>google script to update data, taken from OverPass Turbo</li>
<li>update a log of usage, filled from the map page</li>
<li>use the log to see what data needs to be updated</li>
</ul>
