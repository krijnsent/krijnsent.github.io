<h1>Murals on a Map (v1)</h1>
<p>
    A hobby project to map out murals in Utrecht, NL. This first version took a lot of manual labor, especially the resizing of photos :-).
    The images I use are of poor quality, I scaled them to max 300px.
    That is on purpose: the best way to enjoy these murals is to be in front of them.
    So enjoy this site as your guide for a nice bike ride :).
